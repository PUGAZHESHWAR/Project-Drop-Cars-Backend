# Driver API Documentation

This document describes the APIs available for car drivers in the Drop Cars system.

## Base URL
```
http://localhost:8000/api/users
```

## Authentication
Most driver APIs require Bearer token authentication. The token is obtained through the signin process.

## API Endpoints

### 1. Driver Signin

3. **Exclude cancelled orders**: Orders with trip_status "CANCELLED" are not returned

**Order Status Values:**
- `trip_status`: PENDING, CONFIRMED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, CANCELLED
- `assignment_status`: PENDING, ASSIGNED, CANCELLED, COMPLETED, DRIVING

## Data Models

### Driver Status Enum
```python
class AccountStatusEnum(str, Enum):
    ONLINE = "ONLINE"      # Driver is available for assignments
    DRIVING = "DRIVING"    # Driver is currently on a trip
    BLOCKED = "BLOCKED"    # Driver is offline/unavailable
```

### Assignment Status Enum
```python
class AssignmentStatusEnum(str, Enum):
    PENDING = "PENDING"       # Order assigned but not yet started
    ASSIGNED = "ASSIGNED"     # Order assigned and confirmed
    CANCELLED = "CANCELLED"   # Assignment was cancelled
    COMPLETED = "COMPLETED"   # Trip completed successfully
    DRIVING = "DRIVING"       # Driver is currently driving
```

---

## Usage Examples

### 1. Driver Signin Flow
```bash
# Step 1: Signin to get access token
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/users/cardriver/signin" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "primary_number": "+919876543210",
    "password": "your_password"
  }'

# Step 2: Use the token for subsequent requests
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:8000/api/users/cardriver/online" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>"
```

### 2. Update Driver Status
```bash
# Set driver online
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:8000/api/users/cardriver/online" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>"

# Set driver offline
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:8000/api/users/cardriver/offline" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>"
```

### 3. Get Pending Orders
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/orders/vehicle_owner/pending" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>"
```

## Security Considerations

1. **JWT Tokens**: All authenticated endpoints require valid JWT tokens
2. **Token Expiry**: Tokens expire after 30 minutes by default
3. **Driver Isolation**: Drivers can only access their own data and status
4. **Password Hashing**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage
5. **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated using Pydantic schemas

---

## Rate Limiting

Currently, no rate limiting is implemented. Consider implementing rate limiting for production use.

---

## Notes

- All timestamps are in UTC timezone
- Mobile numbers should follow Indian format (+91XXXXXXXXXX or XXXXXXXXXX)
- Driver status changes are immediate and affect order assignment eligibility
- Pending orders are filtered based on business rules to ensure only available orders are shown
